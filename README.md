# Upper Z-belt clamps for a flipped Voron V2 gantry

My Doomcube uses a flipped gantry where motors are placed from the top side in order to provide more clerance between gantry and Z-idlers.

Flipping the gantry switches positions of upper and lower z-belt clips. Since upper clips manage the excess belts, this mod allows the belt to pass through a slot in the clip in order to reduce the chance of belt rubbing on the side panels.
